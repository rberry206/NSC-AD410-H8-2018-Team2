5-9-18 Update
Role: Front end

Today I took somewhat of a break from the website to work on other important coursework. I did do a lot of communicating with my
team via slack. We discussed a to-do list of front-end items that need to be addressed over the weekend. Yesterday, the 
10th, I spent about 7 hours building a completely new home page for our site. I did this because I wanted there to be
a sort of shell/template for other members of the front-end team to go off of. The previous version of HTML/CSS that we
had was very difficult to interpret. I think that what I have created will greatly simplify the rest of the process
with the front end. I did this by carefully organizing the code and using an extensive amount of commenting so anyone
working on the secondary pages, or even changing the home page, will know where everything is and what to do with it.
