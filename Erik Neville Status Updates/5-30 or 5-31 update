What have you completed since the last report?
Since I didn't have internet connection over the holliday weekend, which I explained in my last
post, I'm posting again after what I've been working on today. Here's what I did:
- I changed the hover behavior on the link which returns the user to the main blog page
  while they are viewing a single blog post.
- I removed some borders that separate the search bar on the blog from the featured post
  below the search bar. I did this by removing the border attribute in the blogstyle.css and
  instead added a custom <hr> tag within the html of the main blog page.
- I added some jQuery to the navbar links so that they slightly enlarge when they are hovered
  over in desktop views, just to add a little flair to the page.
- I fixed the issue with all paged related to the blog, where the footer links were floating
  to the right side of the screen. Now they align in a the same way that they do with every
  other page of our project.
- I helped Dawitt reformat the pop-up for subscribing to the newsletter to become mobile friendly
- I showed Dao how to add banners to the products page using the version of Bootstrap that we are using

What do you plan to complete by next report?
- I will be adding social media links for Google+ to each secondary page. Currently it only appears
  on the home page.
- I am going to create some separation between the two main body containers on the home page so that
  they stand out a little more. Part of that includes rearanging the image locations on smaller/mobile
  windows, so that the images don't stack one on top of another. Instead it will be 'image, text, image text'
  design.
- I am going to make sure that the font provided by the client is only present in the navbar section, and will
  be different everywhere else on all pages.
- I am going to work on making the blog page's search bar scale better with different screen sizes.
- I am going to at "alt" components to each image on all pages as per proper HTML writing.
- Lower on the priority list now, I'm going to format the dropdown nav menu to be more UX friendly.
