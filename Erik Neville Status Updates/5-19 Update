What have you completed since the last report?
I was able to remove the scrollbar on the banner's independent scrolling section on my own machine, but I'm
Having trouble seeing the result when I upload the files to the server. I worked a very long shift at work
yesterday, which is why I'm posting this today, because I will be able to get more work done on the site today.

What do you plan to complete by next report?
I want to have the independent banner scroll section's bar gone, and I want to have some scss written so that
the font size will adjust according to scren size.
