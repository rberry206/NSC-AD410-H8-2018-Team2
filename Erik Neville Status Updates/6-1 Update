Role: Front End

What have you completed since the last report?
- Added alt statements to each <img> tag
- Loaded all of the fonts that Priyanka wanted to use into our css file using @font-face.
- Adjusted sizing and weight of font in certain parts of certain pages.
- Organized my version records of the changes we've made to the site, which proved useful
  because somehow the blog pages were improperly manipulated by someone on our FTP.
- Created a new GitHub repository with our most recent changes to each file so that every team
  member can clone from it to quickly store and change files on their own computers.
- Made the image responsive, and centered as the background of our "safe zone" page. Then
  we decided we didn't want an image there so I removed it.
- Right aligned all links that appear inside of the dropdown menu when in small browser windows
  or mobile.
- 

What do you plan to complete by next report?
- I'm going to make some of the buttons/links on our pages stand out with some jQuery.
- I'm going to make sure that we have no extranious files built into our site.
- I am going to make the social media links a little bit bigger when viewing the site on a
  small screen
- I'm going to look through the blog sections folders to help Michael make the "featured" blog
  post picture appear larger than it currently does.
- I will be available on Slack to help assist anyone who needs help with any front end work.
