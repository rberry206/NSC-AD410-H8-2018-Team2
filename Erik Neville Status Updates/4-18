Role: Front End

Today I pushed my site concept to Github. In class I showed my design ideas, and as a group we
decided which direction we would take based on the other idea that we saw. I will continue to
look at examples and experiment with my own design until next week, when we will decide as a group
how to commit to a somewhat finalized front end design.
