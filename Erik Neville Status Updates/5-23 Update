What have you completed since the last report?
- Formatted the banner of each page to stay attatched to the navigation bar.
- Updated the top left logo image in the nav bar to be the same on each page.
- Reformatted the initial size of the banner on each secondary page (about, contact, etc...)
- Using ther @media call I made it so that all of the banners will be a much smaller size on
  mobile, because they were previously taking up the whole page when using a mobile device.

What do you plan to complete by next report?
My priority list is as follows:
  1) Make the tiles of each blog post look better using our Bootstrap framework
  2) Same as above but for the sign up popup window
  3) Remove the independent scrolling secion of the home page (per client request)
  4) Work on reformating the shape and behavior of the dropdown navigation menu
      when in mobile mode. More specifically: it still needs to hide when a user clicks
      anywhere outside of it, and it should drop down when clicked to only take up the
      top right portion of the page.
