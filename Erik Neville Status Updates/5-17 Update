5-17-18 Status Update
Role: Front End

  Today I had to be at work at 4:00am so I did not provide a status report for yesterday. Yesterday, the 16th,
I worked on connecting all of the front end together with a similar layout, navigation bar and footer. I added
padding to the sites where the text was reaching all of the way out to the edges of the screen. I met with Dawit,
Betelhem, Michael, and Ryan two hours before class to explain some Bootstrap CSS concepts and cover any last minute
details, since we were expecting to present to the client. 

  Moving forward, I still need to make it so that the collapsed navigation button will expand and collapse the
navigation bar when clicked outside of the navigation box. I know that I can accomplish this using javascript, I 
just have to do a workaround of the Bootstrap framework. The other things I will be working on are tying our banner,
which is our large picture on the middle of each page, to the navigation bar. Finally I will be implimenting 
fluid typography so that the font size will change with each screen sizes.
