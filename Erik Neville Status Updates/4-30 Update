Role: Front End

What have you completed since the last report?
I completed the slight modifications to Phu's idex.htm page. Those changes included removing certain header items, certain
social media items at the bottom, and adding space to the section containing privacy policy, legal, and contact us links

What do you plan to complete by next report?
After connecting with the group I will see which direction I need to go. I'm hoping to start merging the home page with 
other static pages soon.
