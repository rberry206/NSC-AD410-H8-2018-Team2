Role: Front End

As of today I haven't worked on our specific site page necessarily. What I have done is continued to practice
front end development for several other sites that I'm working on. I'm continuing to improve my proficiencies
in responsive web design, being that our group's site will likely only be viewed on mobile devices (phones and tablets).

As I continue to learn new skills I will implement them into our groups page once we create our next direction with
front-end design.
