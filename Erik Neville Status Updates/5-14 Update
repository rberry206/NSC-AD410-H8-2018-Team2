5-14-18 Status Update
Role: Front End

Today and Saturday I worked on further developing the look of the home page of our website.
I decided today to experiment with adding an independent scrolling feature within the main banner
of our site. I spoke with a friend who is a marketing consultant for I.T. and she insisted that
our design had too many steps for a potential client to go through from entering the website,
to purchasing a product. I decided to add an animated button at the bottom of the banner, proceeding
some catchy text (which someone else in the team will have to alter, because creative writing isn't
coming to me right now). 

I sent this new format to Ryan, and will present it to the team on Wednesday. My main thought moving
forward is that the majority of the target client for this site will want the option to purchase something
right away if they want to, and not have to read several paragraphs first, and navigate to other pages
through the header.
