Today I finalized my first design build of a responsive home page. I included links to social media on the bottom
of the page, as well as terms of use and other conditions. Once the front end members of our team have posted and agreed on a
style of home page to proceed with, I will easily be able to implement the things that I've been working on with my own
design.
