Role: Front End

Today in class the group decided to stick with the same design that was created but to simplify things by using a Bootstrap
framework. The purpose of this decision was to make it easier for other front end team memembers, and potentially our client
to make changes and add content. The previous CSS file we had was too hard to understand and too hard to make into a mobile
friendly layout. I volunteered to completely redo the home page (index.html) to be clearly understood and mobile friendly.

My goal is to have a working index.html file posted by tomorrow night which can be used as a backbone for the rest of the
front end team. I will create easy to understand and clearly commented containers which other team memebers can change,
remove, and add to to make the whole process of creating a good looking front end much easier.
