Role: Front End

What have you completed since the last report?
  - I really enjoyed all the front end work I've done for this project. It tought me that I really have
    a passion for front end web app development. 
  - Learning about client-oriented, team based, web design, tought me a great deal.
  - I finished any last minute changes to the design of the website. That includes producing the 
    "mission statement", and "out team", sections of the site. 

What do you plan to complete by next report?
  - I know there won't be a next report, but I have gained a lot of insight about how I would aproach this
    task in the future.
    
    I spent many hours researching how Bootstrap works, so that our site could be responsive to many screen sizes. 
    What I learned is the the Bootstrap Framework is an excellent learning
    tool to expand on. With future projects in mind, I will use the functionality that I learned
    from this project, to implement designs in my own way. It was too difficult to overwrite certain
    Bootstrap functionality. That and their source code contained more content than I had time to
    learn with my schedule.
    
    Overall I'm very happy with the way my team mates worked with eachother; I think our end result looks
    beautiful. I think that everyone in the course was able to take something important away.
