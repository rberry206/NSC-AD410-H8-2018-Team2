Erik Neville 4-25 Status Update

Role: Front End

Today I created a dropdown menue for the products tab. After our group met we decided that there is not enough
products in development to warrent a dropdown tab, so my goal moving forward this week will be to look through
our existing home page and clean up the header and footer, and eliminate any of the extrenuous items that
we learned aren't needed today in class.
