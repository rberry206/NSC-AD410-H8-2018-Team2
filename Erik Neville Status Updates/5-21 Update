What have you completed since the last report?
I created some extra CTA buttons for the home page. I added some animation on hover and click to the buttons
by overriding the Bootstrap jQuery. 

What do you plan to complete by next report?
I'm still not able to remove the independent banner scolling secion's scroll bar, that is my highest priority
moving forward.
