Status Report 5-14
Role: Backend

What have you completed since the last report?
1) Implemented the Google SignIn for the newsletter.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?
1) Add some more styling and fix the cookie to last a week. I decided to scrap
all of the code I had for the previous newsletter pop-up. I built mine from scratch instead.


What is getting in your way?
1) I need to be able to visual the main/home page finished to style the pop-up and make sure the functionality is working
after loading it onto the server. Making sure all bugs and errors are resolved.
