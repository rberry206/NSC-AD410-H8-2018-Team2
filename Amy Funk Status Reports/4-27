1) Mike is working on setting up the WordPress account and all custom blog design has been scraped.I coded the newsletter pop-up
just not super sure of where to upload the code.

2) Need to incorporate a theme that matches our ongoing design for the website. Need to figure out blog color/design/typography etc

3) Need to get word on where to upload my code and if my team wants me to incorporate it into the already front-end design or
will I work with someone else to incorporate it together.
