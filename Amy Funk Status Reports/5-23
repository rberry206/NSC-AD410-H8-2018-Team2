Status Report 5-23
Role: Backend

What have you completed since the last report?
1) Newsletter modal is functional on website now with Google authentication signin.I was able to properly logon to the server.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?
1)The database backend build for storing of the emails. 

What is getting in your way?
1)Nothing currently. I would say the groups neglect to use GitHub to store our code is creating problems.
We need to have some sort of version control because so many people are grabbing from the FTP
and uploading over other peoples changes.
