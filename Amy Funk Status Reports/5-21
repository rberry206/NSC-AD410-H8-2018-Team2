Status Report 5-21
Role: Backend

What have you completed since the last report?
1) Began construction of second modal.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?
1)Have the second modal implemented fully, I will admit that I cannot fully remember what the second modal was for and need to link
up with my group to figure out the details.

What is getting in your way?
1) I still cannot properly log onto the ftp server, it keeps giving me an error as if I'm entering the incorrect password. Which 
is prohibiting me from being able to upload onto the live site.
