Role: Backend (Blog)

1) Mike has tackled the blog task while I've taken the login portion of the project so admin only have access to the blog.

2) Login and workable blog should be testable by the end of the week.

3) If testing goes well we can ask the group for input as to what features to implement in the extra time given,

4) Still wondering if we'll have contact with the client to get feedback on our ideas, or are we just going to demo in class and get feedback from classmates and teacher?

5) After Blog/Login is fully implemented we'll probably end up reaching out to other teammates to see is they might need assistance.
