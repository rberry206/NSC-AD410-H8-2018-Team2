1) Finishing up design of newsletter

2) Submitting my code finished for the newsletter applied on the home page

3) With all of the new features that were added, I want to know how my group will be implementing them. I don't want to run out of time and miss on some easy implementation of features. Also, if research may be needed for some features we should start now.
