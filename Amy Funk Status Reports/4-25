Role: Backend

1) Put a halt on blog work, meeting with client to see if she prefers WordPress or custom blog. She wants WordPress.

2) Ryan assigned me the new task of making the newsletter popup when you access the site. I need to do a bit of research on how to actually implement the code, and remember to set a cookie for a weeks amount of length. Math!

3) I'm going to begin implementation of the pop-up newletter and work with Mike to establish the WordPress blog for the client.
