Status Report 5-11
Role: Backend

What have you completed since the last report?
1) Found a tutorial to iplement the Google authentication option with the newsletter sign-up

What do you plan to complete by the next report?
1) Integrating the compelted newsletter with authentication onto the main page.


What is getting in your way?
1) I'm not sure if the main page that is uploaded is the content that we're using. Not sure who is handling the main page at this point, but I would like to be able to clone the project (the most accurate project) so i can start testing to see if the newsletter is working.
I wrote to my team, hoping for a respoinse soon so the authentication doesn't become a problem if I run into any issues.
