Status Report 5-18
Role: Backend

What have you completed since the last report?
1) The newsletter modal is now fully functioning.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?
1)I hope to have the other modal needed for the contact page (not exactly sure what page it's going on, but it's the same 
concept).

What is getting in your way?
1) Logging onto the FTP. I'm somewhat waiting on the front page to be finished to implement the modal so i can see if it is still fully
functioning when the page goes live.
