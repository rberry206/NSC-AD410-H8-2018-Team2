Status Report 5-30
Role: Backend

What have you completed since the last report?
1)Beta pop-up and created databases for email storage.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?
1)Both beta pop up and newsletter should be fully functioning.

What is getting in your way?
1)Group decision changes. Alterations to designs, not using GitHub is making it somewhat difficult to keep up with changes.
Aside from that working my normal full-time job is getting me a bit stressed out with projects approaching due dates.
