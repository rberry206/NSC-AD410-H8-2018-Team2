What have you completed since the last report?
I have been working with my team member Betelhem editing our page logo image. 
I will aslo continue improving my web design to gain more knowledge.

What do you plan to complete by next report?
We hope to have the logo image displayed by our next meeting. 

What is getting in your way?
I search a lot of ideas and way of other designs and that consumes a lot of my time. 
I also work at a slower pace and I hope to improve that by repetition.
