Role: Front End

What have you completed since the last report?
We met in class with our group members and discussed our next step to improving out web page.
Our team leader provided the logo from our client and i got assigned to implement the image.

What do you plan to complete by next report?
I will have the logo image displayed in our page and hope to continue improving my design to gain more knowledge.

What is getting in your way?
I search a lot of ideas and way of other layout designs and that consumes a lot of time. 
I also work at a slower pace and hope to improve that in time by repetition.
