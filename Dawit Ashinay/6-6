What do you plan to complete by next report?

-I met with Betelhem and we redesigned our logo image and displayed it to the safe zone page making 
it phone compatible. Tested our result in different devices to make sure nothing is broken. 
-We presented the final page to our client. I had a great experience working in a large group and 
I learned gained many good learning experience. I couldnâ€™t ask for a better hard working group members.


What is getting in your way?
-Time and working in a slow pace.
