What have you completed since the last report?
What do you plan to complete by next report?

I have been searching for a good banner image to replace the home banner image.
I will share with my team and try to see if they all agree. I took a task to work on the 
homepage pop-up banner with Betelhem. Its currently not functioning correctly on a mobile device 
and we hope to have ready by our next meeting.


What is getting in your way?
Working at a slower pace and not having enough time to add more functions to our page.
