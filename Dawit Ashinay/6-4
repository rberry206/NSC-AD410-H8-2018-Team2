What have you completed since the last report?
What do you plan to complete by next report?

-I met with Betelhem and displayed the safe zone background image.
Our previous background image was voted to be replaced. 
We placed a better background image and it seems to be off centered 
on mobile and we are working that fixed as soon as possible.

-We will also meet tomorrow and work on the pop-up box display. 
Someone had made some changes on the CSS and it seems to be malfunctioning.  

- Will check the entire page with the front-end teammates 
and make sure everything works properly and finalize our page.  

What is getting in your way?

-The Safe Zone background image is set to be displaced at the bottom right and itâ€™s 
an image of our logo standing on a tree so when we displayed on mobile the image gets 
pushed more than it should. We decided to have the image as an aside in class to today 
I believe that should debug the issue.

-Working with Mac could be a bit difficult sometimes compared to pc.

-Time to better research and improve our page.
