What have you completed since the last report?

What do you plan to complete by next report?

I have asked our team leader if its necessary to place a banner images for our Legal and Safe-Zone page 
and if so what image we should use. We had scheduled a group meeting for today 
but do to a serious family emergency that came up at the last minutes we rescheduled it to the coming Wednesday. 
I will talk to our instructor for further details. 


What is getting in your way?
I joined the front-end team because that is my weakness and even though Iâ€™m work at a slower pace which 
consumes a lot of my time but the more i research and work on our page I have developed my skills and 
I am working at a much better pace.
