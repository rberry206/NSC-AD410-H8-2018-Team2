What have you completed since the last report?
What do you plan to complete by next report?

I have taken a task to work on our web banners with a front-end team member Betelhem editing our page today 
and we plan on having them displayed by our next meeting Wednesday.

What is getting in your way?
I search a lot of ideas and way of other designs. 
I also work at a slower pace which consumes a lot of my time. 
I have to find a good banner images and resize it to better fit the banner and implement the codes in to the CSS.
