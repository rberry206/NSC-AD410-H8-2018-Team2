What have you completed since the last report?
What do you plan to complete by next report?

Today my teammates and I worked on fixing the banners for our page. 
We were only able to have banners function for half our pages. Betelhem and I will continue finishing banners. 
We have also scheduled a meet up time with Phu and Hau to work on our blog page. 


What is getting in your way?
The design of the codes has been placed within WordPress and that consumes a longer 
time finding and implement the proper banners. Erik and Ryan were able to meet up with us 
today and enlighten us on some of their knowledges.
