Role: Front End
05/25/2018


What have you completed since the last report?
What do you plan to complete by next report?

The banners have all been removed except for the main home page.
I have been looking to ideas to improve out page and share with our group.
I am waiting on the back-end and team leader for a task to help in the front-end. 


What is getting in your way?
Working at a slower pace and a lot to do in just two weeks.
