What have you completed since the last report?
What do you plan to complete by next report?

-I met with Betelhem and worked on displaying a background image for our safe zone page, created a sign up for betta button 
for our homepage, worked on resizing and implementing images to our testimonial. Made sure everything was displaying properly 
on both web and mobile.
- I recently communicated with Ryan and decided to replace our safe Zone background image and we will have that ready by tomorrow. 
- Will check the entire page with the front-end teammates and make sure everything works properly and finalize our page.  


What is getting in your way?

-Working with Mac could be a bit difficult sometimes compared to pc.
