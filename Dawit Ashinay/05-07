What have you completed since the last report?

I have been working with my team member Betelhem. We completed editing the logo image 
and waiting until we meet with our team members to get feedback.  

What do you plan to complete by next report?
We will have the edited logo image displayed on our web page by Wednesday.

What is getting in your way?
I also work at a slower pace and I hope to improve that by doing more research and many repetition.
