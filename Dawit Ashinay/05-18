What have you completed since the last report?
What do you plan to complete by next report?

We finished working on the banners for each page. I have also been looking in to
ways to better improve our front-end web page. We have a meet up time scheduled with few 
teammates to work on the blog page. We hope to have that completed by our next meeting  


What is getting in your way?
I work at a slower pace and that consumes a lot of my time.
