What have you completed since the last report?

- As we discussed in the class, I've started looking into 3 fields to fix the issues that we face as a team

1. How to use a single Wordpress database for both the blog and products because currently they are two separate
2. How to make a design based modification available to the owner so that she can do it in a design mode without touching the code
3. How to import a Blogger blog to Wordpress

Also, continued working on the search engine optimization report for her as she requested one from our team.
  
What do you plan to complete by the next report?
- will have continued working on the SEO report for her.
- will have a conclusion whether the 3 questions can be resolved by next week.
  
What is getting in your way?
- lack of knowledge in Wordpress poses a problem.
- time crunch.
