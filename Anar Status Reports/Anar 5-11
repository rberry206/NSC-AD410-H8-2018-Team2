What have you completed since the last report?
  Started researching and working on a stable javascript code that would display an Android image on an Android phone or iPhone image on an iPhone.
  The code is an optimal addition to the webdesign and it's encouraged to be used. It was discussed in the class on last Wednesday.
  Continued looking at SEO additions on Wordpress. I thought it was helpful to have a SEO add on for the owner for the longevity purposes.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?
  I'll have a material research on the SEO keywords and probable feasibility study on the java code mentioned above. 
  
What is getting in your way?
  The teammembers were saying the javascript code may take a long time to develop. I'm looking into cutting that time allocation.
