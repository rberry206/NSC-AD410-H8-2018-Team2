Role: Middle/Backend

1) Messaged with my teammate to tackle the blog fiasco with. Not sure what the plan is going to be, a lot of wordpress talk.

¯\_(ツ)_/¯

2) Our group decided to research for some other relatable websites we could brainstorm from, I came up with these:
  a)https://www.commonsensemedia.org/lists/best-apps-for-kids-age-5-8
  b)https://www.bestappsforkids.com/
  c)http://topbestappsforkids.com/

3)I found the blog, "blogger" that the client is currently using, I'm wondering if we may be able to manipulate the API to be incorporated in the website somehow. We need to bring up the concerns of the blog to the client, if she is comfortable moving the blog location.
