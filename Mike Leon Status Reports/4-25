1) Helped demo project with Ryan today
2) After presentation we decided to scrap the CMS after consulting with the client and other group mates. The CMS I was constructing 
may be unreliable long term and made more sense to use wordpress.
3)Talked with amy and agreed i'll figure out the blog situation and talk to her once I understand it a little

Todo's
1) Figure out how tou se wordpress for both the products page AND blog
2) Once I figure out wordpress more I will consult with Amy about constructing our pages using it and I will
have her assist me after she finishes the newsletter popup

Learnt
1)Sometimes its better to just use a tool that already exists and serves as industry standard instead of trying to recreat the wheel
2)And sometimes the client thinks this same way
