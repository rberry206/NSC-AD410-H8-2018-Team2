Middle Tier
1)Worked on the CMS all night
2)Set up database functionality
3)Got add function working to add blog contents into database
4)We now have a base to collect the data and use for future

Plans
I will be working on the deletion function this Sunday and also planning on figuring out how to create templates for the data
so we can just input said data into a template for a seamless integration when client needs to add a new blog.

More features to come but the most important part for getting the blog started is done.

I will also start uploading my project files to git for the blog so that the team can view it.
