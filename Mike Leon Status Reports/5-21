Middle Tier
1)Followed tutorials Bob gave me for selenium
2)Ryan told me to start working on the blog again to help front-end
3)Ran some preliminary tests for buttons on the homepage.

To-Do
1)Recreate tile design for the blog
2)Create more tests using Selenium (Goal being to test -EVERYTHING-)

What is getting in your way?
1)Time management, finding more time to balance work and other homework to finalize my portion of the project
2)Design keeps going back and forth delaying the blog from being completed.
