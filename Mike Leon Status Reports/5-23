Middle Tier
1)Quickly edited my blog to be presentation ready
2)Talked to client about how the blog should be styled

To-Do
1)switch to a 9 x 9 tile set up
2)add search functionality
3)figure out how to link the two wordpress on the website

What is getting in your way?
1)Time management, finding more time to balance work and other homework to finalize my portion of the project
2)Design keeps going back and forth delaying the blog from being completed.
3)New specs being learned late in the project.
