Role: Mid-Back End.
Group discussion in class today to go over the website logo, everyone's part and to have a complete site roll out by nextweek.
Re-arraged the product's page.
Talked with Mike if we can merge the product page or use wordpress instead.
Mike will try to work on the wordpress part while I continue to improve the product's page in PHP.
