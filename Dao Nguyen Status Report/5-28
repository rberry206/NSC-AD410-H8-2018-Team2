What have you completed since the last report?
  I have not done anything news since the last report. I had a personal business that I had to go out out town for 3 days. 
  Before I left I asked everyone in the team if they need anything from me before I go. I will work hard the next couple
  of days to catch up with my work.
  
What do you plan to complete by the next report?
  Have to banner ready, I am not sure how the team want to do with banner. Banners had been taken down.
  Get the product's page filled with contents.
  Get the content formatted with our client's fonts.

What is getting in your way?
  I went out of town for a personal business for 3 days where I didn't have access to my laptop.
