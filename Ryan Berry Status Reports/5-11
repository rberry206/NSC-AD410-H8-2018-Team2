Status Report for 5-11

What have you completed since the last report?
- Completed a good amount of css for all of the pages so that they are mobile friendly
- Discussed with Michael ideas for the design of the blog
- Discussed with group members for custom CSS elements that they needed for their individual pages
- Started brainstorming ideas for a better banner


What do you plan to complete by the next report?
- See if we can get the blog to a point where it will be
- Get the site fully operational for Wednesday
- Discuss any further developments with group members on their individual pages

What is getting in your way?
- Completely scrapping the CSS has left us a little un-refined on a lot of pages, we need to brainstorm new ideas for the site quickly
  because we're running out of time
- Getting in contact with every group member on Slack continues to be a hassle, even after talking to them in class
