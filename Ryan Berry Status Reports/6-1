Status Report for 6-1

What have you completed since the last report?
- So many things...
- Finished design on front page
- Removed Pokemon images from front page, added real images
- Fixed spacing issues on front page with Michael
- Completed total API json call... still working on smaller calls
- Changed titles on all pages to match
- Changed Safe Zone page to feel more inclusive (will probably wind up changing background image)

What do you plan to complete by the next report?
- Finish smaller, single product API json call
- Start writing guides for Priyanka
- Make sure everything of note is commented in our code

What is getting in your way?
- Multiple people working on the FTP at one time screwed us over multiple times today
------ In the future, we will push everything from Github to the FTP to save the hassle
- Time is running out, some people aren't finishing work very quickly
