Status Report for 5-23

What have you completed since the last report?
- Presented project to Priyanka
- Discussed ways to improve site, especially the blog
- Talked with Michael and Erik about updating blog
- Talked with Shota to add a capcha to the Contact page
- Worked on the project for a few hours leading up to class, adding a bunch of features that will inevitably not make it

What do you plan to complete by the next report?
- Redo the entire blog format
- Try to connect the two Wordpress accounts for blog/products
- Reformat a few pages to look nicer

What is getting in your way?
- Now that we're adding a ton of features two weeks seems like an awfully short amount of time to finish
- We've had to scrap the blog about 3 times now and it has been very time consuming
