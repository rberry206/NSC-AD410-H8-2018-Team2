What have you completed since the last report?
- Started learning Selenium testing
- Looked up designs for boxes on the Home page
- Worked with front end team on new banners


What do you plan to complete by the next report?
- Complete work on the home page to make it seem more modern, it's divided in an old-school html style right now
- Talk with Amy about the popup ads
- Try to implement buttons on the home page

What is getting in your way?
- This feels like a lull in terms of amount of work to do for some people, so trying to find them roles is difficult
