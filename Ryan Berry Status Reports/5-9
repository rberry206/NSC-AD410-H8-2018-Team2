Status Report for 5-9

What have you completed since the last report?
- Discussed with group for whole-sale changes to CSS
- Decided to redo entire styling with Erik so that the site looks better on mobile
- Told everyone their roles moving forward (a lot of waiting for now)


What do you plan to complete by the next report?
- I plan to finish the new css containers with Erik
- I'll try to get every page fitted with the new css, but for now they are all functional

What is getting in your way?
- We have to change a lot and we're pretty far in so time is a bit of an issue
- Getting in contact with team members who weren't in class is always a challenge.
